# Tarsnap Plugin for NodeBB

This is a Tarsnap plugin for NodeBB. Keep in mind it is merely an interface, and **you still have to figure
out how to install Tarsnap on your server** before this plugin is of any use.

## What's Tarsnap?

Tarsnap is a secure, efficient online backup service. It was made by Colin Percival (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦!)

## How do I set it up?

You'll want to check out [the "Getting Started" guide](https://www.tarsnap.com/gettingstarted.html), set
up your account, and install Tarsnap to the server hosting your NodeBB files (or honestly, whatever
else you want to archive).

Then, install the plugin, `./nodebb build`, and configure the plugin in the plugin page.
